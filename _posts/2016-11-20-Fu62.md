title: Long Short-term Memory Network over Rhetorical Structure Theory for Sentence-level
  Sentiment Analysis
abstract: Using deep learning models to solve sentiment analysis of sentences is still
  a challenging task. Long short-term memory (LSTM) network solves the gradient disappeared
  problem existed in recurrent neural network (RNN), but LSTM structure is linear
  chain-structure that can’t capture text structure information. Afterwards, Tree-LSTM
  is proposed, which uses LSTM forget gate to skip sub-trees that have little effect
  on the results to get good performance. It illustrates that the chain-structured
  LSTM more strongly depends on text structure. However, Tree-LSTM can’t clearly figure
  out which sub-trees are important and which sub-trees have little effect. We propose
  a simple model which uses Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for text parsing. By
  building LSTM network on RST parse structure, we make full use of LSTM structural
  characteristics to automatically enhance the nucleus information and  filter the
  satellite information of text. Furthermore, this approach can make the representations
  concerning the relations between segments of text, which can improve text semantic
  representations. Experiment results show that this method not only has higher classification
  accuracy, but also trains quickly.
