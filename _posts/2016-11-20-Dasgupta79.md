title: Fast Collaborative Filtering from Implicit Feedback with Provable Guarantees
abstract: Building recommendation algorithm is one of the most challenging tasks in
  Machine Learning. Although most of the recommendation systems are built on explicit
  feedback available from the users in terms of rating or text, a majority of the
  applications do not receive such feedback. Here we consider the recommendation task
  where the only available data is the records of user-item interaction over web applications
  over time, in terms of subscription or purchase of items; this is known as implicit
  feedback recommendation. There is usually a massive amount of such user-item interaction
  available for any web applications. Algorithms like PLSI or Matrix Factorization
  runs several iterations through the dataset and may prove very expensive for large
  datasets. Here we propose a recommendation algorithm based on Method of Moment,
  which involves factorization of second and third order moments of the dataset. Our
  algorithm can be proven to be globally convergent using PAC learning theory. Further,
  we show how to extract the parameters using only three passes through the entire
  dataset. This results in a highly scalable algorithm that scales up to million of
  users even on a machine with a single-core processor and 8 GB RAM and produces competitive
  performance in comparison with existing algorithms.
