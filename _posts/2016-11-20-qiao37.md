title: Linearized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Constrained Nonconvex
  Regularized Optimization
abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of constrained nonconvex regularized
  minimization problems, where the constraints is linearly constrained. It was reported
  in the literature that nonconvex regularization usually yields a solution with more
  desirable sparse structural properties beyond convex ones. However, it is not easy
  to obtain the proximal mapping associated with nonconvex regularization, due to
  the imposed linearly constraints. In this paper, the optimization problem with linear
  constraints is solved by the Linearized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
  (LADMM). Moreover, we present a detailed convergence analysis of the LADMM algorithm
  for solving nonconvex compositely regularized optimization with a large class of
  nonconvex penalties. Experimental results on several real-world datasets validate
  the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
