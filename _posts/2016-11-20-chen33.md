title: Unifying Topic, Sentiment & Preference in an HDP-Based Rating Regression Model
  for Online Reviews
abstract: This paper proposes a new HDP based online review rating regression model
  named Topic-Sentiment-Preference Regression Analysis (TSPRA). TSPRA combines topics
  (i.e. product as-pects), word sentiment and user preference as regression factors,
  and is able to perform topic clus-tering, review rating prediction, sentiment analysis
  and what we invent as “critical aspect” analysis altogether in one framework. TSPRA
  extends sentiment approaches by integrating the key concept “user preference” in
  collaborative filtering (CF) models into consideration, while it is distinct from
  current CF models by decoupling “user preference” and “sentiment” as independent
  factors. Our experiments conducted on 22 Amazon datasets show overwhelming better
  performance in rating predication against a state-of-art model FLAME (2015) in terms
  of error, Pearson’s Correlation and number of inverted pairs. For sentiment analysis,
  we compare the derived word sentiments against a public sentiment resource SenticNet3
  and our sentiment estimations clearly make more sense in the context of online reviews.
  Last, as a result of the de-correlation of “user preference” from “sentiment”, TSPRA
  is able to evaluate a new concept “critical aspects”, defined as the prod-uct aspects
  seriously concerned by users but negatively commented in reviews. Improvement to
  such “critical aspects” could be most effective to enhance user experience.
