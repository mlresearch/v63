title: Cost Sensitive Online Multiple Kernel Classification
abstract: 'Mining data streams has been an important open research problem in the
  era of big data analytics. This paper investigates supervised machine learning techniques
  for mining data streams with application to online anomaly detection. Unlike conventional
  data mining tasks, mining data streams for online anomaly detection has several
  challenges:  (i) data arriving sequentially and increasing rapidly,  (ii) highly
  class-imbalanced distributions; and  (iii) complex anomaly patterns that could evolve
  dynamically.  To tackle these challenges, we propose Cost-Sensitive Online Multiple
  Kernel Classification (CSOMKC) for comprehensively mining data streams and demonstrate
  its application to online anomaly detection.  Specifically, CSOMKC learns a kernel-based
  cost-sensitive prediction model for imbalanced data streams in a sequential or online
  learning fashion, in which a pool of multiple diverse kernels is dynamically explored.  The
  optimal kernel predictor and the multiple kernel combination are learnt together,
  and simultaneously class imbalance issues are addressed.  We perform theoretical
  and extensive empirical analysis of the proposed algorithms.'
