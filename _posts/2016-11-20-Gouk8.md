title: Learning Distance Metrics for Multi-Label Classification
abstract: Distance metric learning is a well studied problem in the field of machine
  learning, where it is typically used to improve the accuracy of instance based learning
  techniques. In this paper we propose a distance metric learning algorithm that is
  specialised for multi-label classification tasks, rather than the multiclass setting
  considered by most work in this area. The method trains an embedder that can transform
  instances into a feature space where Euclidean distance provides an estimate of
  the Jaccard distance between the corresponding label vectors. In addition to a linear
  Mahalanobis style metric, we also present a nonlinear extension that provides a
  substantial boost in performance. We show that this technique significantly improves
  upon current approaches for instance based multi-label classification, and also
  enables interesting data visualisations.
