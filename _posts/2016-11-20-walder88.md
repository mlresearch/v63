title: 'Modelling Symbolic Music: Beyond the Piano Roll'
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of probabilistically modelling symbolic
  music data. We introduce a representation which reduces polyphonic music to a univariate
  categorical sequence. In this way, we are able to apply state of the art natural
  language processing techniques, namely the long short-term memory sequence model.
  The representation we employ permits arbitrary rhythmic structure, which we assume
  to be given.  We show that our model is effective on all four piano roll based benchmark
  datasets. We further improve our model by augmenting our training data set with
  transpositions of the original pieces through all musical keys, thereby convincingly
  advancing the state of the art on these benchmark problems. We also fit models to
  music which is unconstrained in its rhythmic structure, discuss the properties of
  this model, and provide musical samples which are more sophisticated than previously
  possible with this class of recurrent neural network sequence models. We also provide
  our newly preprocessed data set of non piano-roll music data.  To facilitate future
  work we describe and provide a new carefully preprocessed dataset of 19700 classical
  midi music files â€” significantly more than previously available.
