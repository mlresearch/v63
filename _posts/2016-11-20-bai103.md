title: Hierarchical Probabilistic Matrix Factorization with Network Topology for Multi-relational
  Social Network
abstract: Link prediction in multi-relational social networks has attracted much attention.
  For instance, we may care the chance of two users being friends based on their contacts
  of other patterns, e.g., SMS and phone calls. In previous work, matrix factorization
  models are typically applied in single-relational networks; however, two challenges
  arise to extend it into multi-relational networks. First, the interaction of different
  relation types is hard to be captured. The second is the cold start problem, as
  the prediction of new entities in multi-relational networks becomes even more challenging.
  In this article we propose a novel method called Hierarchical Probabilistic Matrix
  Factorization with Network Topology (HPMFNT). Our model exploits the network topology
  by extending the Katz index into multi-relational settings, which could efficiently
  model the multidimensional interplay via the auxiliary information from other relationships.
  We also utilize the extended Katz index along with entitiy attributes to solve the
  cold-start problem. Experiments on two real world datasets have shown that our model
  outperforms the state-of-the-art with a significant margin.
