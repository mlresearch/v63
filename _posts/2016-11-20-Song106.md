title: Proper Inner Product with Mean Displacement for Gaussian Noise Invariant ICA
abstract: 'Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a classical method for Blind Source
  Separation (BSS). In this paper, we are interested in ICA in the presence of noise,
  i.e., the noisy ICA problem. Pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration (PEGI) is a recent
  cumulant-based method that defines a pseudo Euclidean inner product to replace a
  quasi-whitening step in Gaussian noise invariant ICA. However, PEGI has two major
  limitations: 1) the pseudo Euclidean inner product is improper because it violates
  the positive definiteness of inner product; 2) the inner product matrix is orthogonal
  by design but it has gross errors or imperfections due to sample-based estimation.
  This paper proposes a new cumulant-based ICA method named as PIMD to address these
  two problems. We first define a Proper Inner product (PI) with proved positive definiteness
  and then relax the centering preprocessing step to a mean displacement (MD) step.
  Both PI and MD aim to improve the orthogonality of inner product matrix and the
  recovery of independent components (ICs) in sample-based estimation. We adopt a
  gradient iteration step to find the ICs for PIMD. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real data show the respective effectiveness of PI and MD as well as the superiority
  of PIMD over competing ICA methods. Moreover, MD can improve the performance of
  other ICA methods as well.'
