title: Simulation and Calibration of a Fully Bayesian Marked Multidimensional Hawkes
  Process with Dissimilar Decays
abstract: 'We propose a simulation method for multidimensional Hawkes processes based
  on superposition theory of point processes. This formulation allows us to design
  efficient simulations for Hawkes processes with differing exponentially decaying
  intensities. We demonstrate that inter-arrival times can be decomposed into simpler
  auxiliary variables that can be sampled directly, giving exact simulation with no
  approximation. We establish that the auxiliary variables provides information on
  the parent process for each event time. The algorithm correctness is shown by verifying
  the simulated intensities with their theoretical moments.  A modular inference procedure
  consisting of a combination between Gibbs through the adaptive rejection sampling
  and Metropolis Hastings steps is presented. Finally, we compare our proposed simulation
  method against existing methods, and find significant improvement in terms of algorithm
  speed. Our inference algorithm is used to discover the strengths of mutually excitations
  in real dark networks. '
