title: A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Multi-label Classification
abstract: Many real-world applications require multi-label classification where multiple
  target labels are assigned to each instance. In multi-label classification, there
  exist the intrinsic correlations between the labels and features. These correlations
  are beneficial for multi-label classification task since they reflect the coexistence
  of the input and output spaces that can be exploited for prediction. Traditional
  classification methods have attempted to reveal these correlations in different
  ways. However, existing methods demand expensive computation complexity for finding
  such correlation structures. Furthermore, these approaches can not identify the
  suitable number of label-feature correlation patterns. In this paper, we propose
  a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) framework for multi-label classification that can
  automatically learn and exploit the unknown number of multi-label correlation. We
  utilize the recent techniques in stochastic inference to derive the cheap (but efficient)
  posterior inference algorithm for the model. In addition, our model can naturally
  exploit the useful information from missing label samples. Furthermore, we extend
  the model to update parameters in an online fashion that highlights the flexibility
  of our model against the existing approaches. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art
  multi-label classification algorithms on real-world datasets using both complete
  and missing label settings. Our model achieves better classification accuracy while
  our running time is consistently much faster than the baselines in an order of magnitude.
