title: Random Fourier Features For Operator-Valued Kernels
abstract: Devoted to multi-task learning and structured output learning, operator-valued
  kernels provide a flexible tool to build vector-valued functions in the context
  of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. To scale up these methods, we extend the celebrated
  Random Fourier Feature methodology to get an approximation of operator-valued kernels.
  We propose a general principle for Operator-valued Random Fourier Feature construction
  relying on a generalization of Bochnerâ€™s theorem for translation-invariant operator-valued
  Mercer kernels. We prove the uniform convergence of the kernel approximation for
  bounded and unbounded operator random Fourier features using appropriate Bernstein
  matrix concentration inequality. An experimental proof-of-concept shows the quality
  of the approximation and the efficiency of the corresponding linear models on example
  datasets.
