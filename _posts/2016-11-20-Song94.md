title: 'EcoICA: Skewness-based ICA via Eigenvectors of Cumulant Operator'
abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is an important unsupervised learning
  method. Most popular ICA methods use kurtosis as a metric of non-Gaussianity to
  maximize, such as FastICA and JADE.However, their assumption of kurtosic sources
  may not always be satisfied in practice. For weak-kurtosic but skewed sources, kurtosis-based
  methods could fail while skewness-based methods seem more promising, where skewness
  is another non-Gaussianity metric measuring the non-symmetry of signals. Partly
  due to the common assumption of signal symmetry, skewness-based ICA has not been
  systematically studied in spite of some existing works. In this paper, we take a
  systematic approach to develop EcoICA, a new skewness-based ICA method for weak-kurtosic
  but skewed sources. Specifically, we design a new cumulant operator, define its
  eigenvalues and eigenvectors, reveal their connections with the ICA model to formulate
  the EcoICA problem, and use Jacobi method to solve it. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real data show the superior performance of EcoICA over existing kurtosis-based
  and skewness-based methods for skewed sources. In particular, EcoICA is less sensitive
  to sample size, noise, and outlier than other methods. Studies on face recognition
  further confirm the usefulness of EcoICA in classification.
