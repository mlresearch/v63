title: Echo State Hoeffding Tree Learning
abstract: Nowadays, real-time classification of Big Data streams is becoming essential
  in a variety of application domains. While decision trees are powerful and easy-to-deploy
  approaches for accurate and fast learning from data streams, they are unable to
  capture the strong temporal dependences typically present in the input data. Recurrent
  Neural Networks are an alternative solution that include an internal memory to capture
  these temporal dependences; however their training is computationally very expensive
  and with slow convergence, requiring a large number of hyper-parameters to tune.
  Reservoir Computing was proposed to reduce the computation requirements of the training
  phase but still include a feed-forward layer which requires a large number of parameters
  to tune. In this work we propose a novel architecture for real-time classification
  based on the combination of a Reservoir and a decision tree. This combination reduces
  the number of hyper-parameters while still maintaining the good temporal properties
  of recurrent neural networks. The capabilities of the proposed architecture to learn
  some typical string-based functions with strong temporal dependences are evaluated
  in the paper.  We show how the new architecture is able to incrementally learn these
  functions in real-time with fast adaptation to unknown sequences. And we study the
  influence of the reduced number of hyper-parameters in the behaviour of the proposed
  solution.
