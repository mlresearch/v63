title: Non-Linear Smoothed Transductive Network Embedding with Text Information
abstract: Network embedding is a classical task which aims to map the nodes of a network
  to low-dimensional vectors. Most of the previous network embedding methods are trained
  in an unsupervised scheme. Then the learned node embeddings can be used as inputs
  of many machine learning tasks such as node classification, attribute inference.  However,
  the discrimination validity of the node embeddings maybe improved by considering
  the node label information and the node attribute information.    Inspired by traditional
  semi-supervised learning techniques, we explore to train the node embeddings and
  the node classifiers simultaneously with the text attributes information in a flexible
  framework.  We present NLSTNE (Non-Linear Smoothed Transductive Network Embedding),
  a transductive network embedding method, whose embeddings are enhanced by modeling
  the non-linear pairwise similarity between the nodes and the non-linear relationship
  between the nodes and the text attributes. We use the node classification task to
  evaluate the quality of node embeddings learned by different models on four real-world
  network datasets .  The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms
  several state-of-the-art network embedding methods.
