title: Localized Multiple Kernel Learningâ€”A Convex Approach
abstract: We propose a localized approach to multiple kernel learning that can be
  formulated as a convex optimization problem over a given cluster structure. For
  which we obtain generalization error guarantees and derive an optimization algorithm
  based on the Fenchel dual representation. Experiments on real-world datasets from
  the application domains of computational biology and computer vision show that convex
  localized multiple kernel learning can achieve higher prediction accuracies than
  its global and non-convex local counterparts.
