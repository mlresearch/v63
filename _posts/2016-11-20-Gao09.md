title: Learnability of Non-I.I.D.
abstract: Learnability has always been one of the most central problems in learning
  theory. Most previous studies on this issue were based on the assumption that the
  samples are drawn independently and identically according to an underlying (unknown)
  distribution. The i.i.d. assumption, however, does not hold in many real applications.
  In this paper, we study the learnability of problems where the samples are drawn
  from empirical process of stationary Î²-mixing sequence, which has been a widely-used
  assumption implying a dependence weaken over time in training samples. By utilizing
  the independent blocks technique, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition
  for learnability, that is, average stability is equivalent to learnability with
  AERM (Asymptotic Empirical Risk Minimization) in the non-i.i.d. learning setting.
  In addition, we also discuss the generalization error when the test variable is
  dependent on the training sample.
