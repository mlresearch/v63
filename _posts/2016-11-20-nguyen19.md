title: Multiple Kernel Learning with Data Augmentation
abstract: The motivations of multiple kernel learning (MKL) approach are to increase
  kernel expressiveness capacity and to avoid the expensive grid search over a wide
  spectrum of kernels. A large amount of work has been proposed to improve the MKL
  in terms of the computational cost and the sparsity of the solution. However, these
  studies still either require an expensive grid search on the model parameters or
  scale unsatisfactorily with the numbers of kernels and training samples. In this
  paper, we address these issues by conjoining MKL, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  framework, and data augmentation technique. The pathway of our proposed method is
  developed as follows. We first develop a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) view for MKL
  under a probabilistic setting and described in a graphical model. This view allows
  us to develop data augmentation technique to make the inference for finding the
  optimal parameters feasible, as opposed to traditional approach of training MKL
  via convex optimization techniques. As a result, we can use the standard SGD framework
  to learn weight matrix and extend the model to support online learning. We validate
  our method on several benchmark datasets in both batch and online settings. The
  experimental results show that our proposed method can learn the parameters in a
  principled way to eliminate the expensive grid search while gaining a significant
  computational speedup comparing with the state-of-the-art baselines.
