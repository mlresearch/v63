title: Learning Feature Aware Metric
abstract: Distance Metric Learning (DML) aims to find a distance metric, revealing
  feature relationship and satisfying restrictions between instances, for distance
  based classifiers, e.g., kNN. Most DML methods take all features into consideration
  while leaving the feature importance identification untouched. Feature selection
  methods, on the other hand, only focus on feature weights and are seldom directly
  designed for distance based classifiers. In this paper, we propose a Feature AwaRe
  Metric learning (FARM) method which not only learns the appropriate metric for distance
  constraints but also discovers significant features and their relationships. In
  FARM approach, we treat a distance metric as a combination of feature weighting
  and feature relationship discovering factors. Therefore, by decoupling the metric
  into two parts, it facilitates flexible regularizations for feature importance selection
  as well as feature relationship constructing. Simulations on artificial datasets
  clearly reveal the comprehensiveness of feature weighting for FARM. Experiments
  on real datasets validate the improvement of classification performance and the
  efficiency of our FARM approach.
