title: An Efficient Approach for Multi-Sentence Compression
abstract: 'Multi Sentence Compression (MSC) is of great value to many real world applications,
  such as guided microblog summarization, opinion summarization and newswire summarization.
  Recently, word graph-based approaches have been proposed and become popular in MSC.
  Their key assumption is that redundancy among a set of related sentences provides
  a reliable way to generate informative and grammatical sentences. In this paper,
  we propose an effective approach to enhance the word graph-based MSC and tackle
  the issue that most of the state-of-the-art MSC approaches are confronted with:
  i.e., improving both informativity and grammaticality at the same time. Our approach
  consists of three main components: (1) a merging method based on Multiword Expressions
  (MWE); (2) a mapping strategy based on synonymy between words; (3) a re-ranking
  step to identify the best compression candidates generated using a POS-based language
  model (POS-LM). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach using a
  dataset made of clusters of English newswire sentences. The observed improvements
  on informativity and grammaticality of the generated compressions show an up to
  44% error reduction over state-of-the-art MSC systems.'
