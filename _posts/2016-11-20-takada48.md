title: Secure Approximation Guarantee for Cryptographically Private Empirical Risk
  Minimization
abstract: Privacy concern has been increasingly important in many machine learning
  (ML) problems. We study empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems under secure
  multi-party computation (MPC) frameworks. Main technical tools for MPC have been
  developed based on cryptography. One of limitations in current cryptographically
  private ML is that it is computationally intractable to evaluate non-linear functions
  such as logarithmic functions or exponential functions. Therefore, for a class of
  ERM problems such as logistic regression in which non-linear function evaluations
  are required, one can only obtain approximate solutions. In this paper, we introduce
  a novel cryptographically private tool called secure approximation guarantee (SAG)
  method. The key property of SAG method is that, given an arbitrary approximate solution,
  it can provide a non-probabilistic assumption-free bound on the approximation quality
  under cryptographically secure computation framework. We demonstrate the beneÔ¨Åt
  of the SAG method by applying it to several problems including a practical privacy-preserving
  data analysis task on genomic and clinical information.
